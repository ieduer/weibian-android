# GitHub Actions workload-routing annex

Project: `ieduer/weibian-android` (public).

The default branch has Android verification on push/pull request with a
30-minute ceiling and a separate 10-minute pull-request candidate gate. Keep
unit/lint/contract/build-check coverage. A retained APK or full release build
must be exact-tag or approved manual release work, not an artifact produced for
every ordinary commit. Keep the two gates non-duplicative and add supersedable
concurrency wherever it is absent. Standard public runners do not consume the
private allowance, but timeout and device/release evidence remain mandatory.

## Account boundary

- Workspace authority: `/Users/ylsuen/CF/runbooks/github_actions_usage_and_workload_routing.md`.
- Evidence: `/Users/ylsuen/CF/reports/github_actions_usage_audit_2026-08-22.md`.
- Current reset: **2026-09-01 00:00 UTC** = **2026-08-31 17:00 PDT** =
  **2026-09-01 08:00 CST**. Reset is not remediation and does not authorize
  mass replay.
- Account target is 1,400 private minutes, with day-7/day-14/day-21 checkpoints
  at 350/700/1,050 and freeze/escalation thresholds at 1,400/1,600/1,800/2,000.
- No schedule is authorized by this annex. Any future schedule must record owner,
  maximum runtime/monthly minutes, request and job timeouts, concurrency,
  disable path and last-duration readback.

## Synchronization status

This is a documentation-only, task-scoped annex. Existing operations files or
adjacent source were already dirty/untracked, so they were not rewritten. Use
GitHub's current default-branch tree as the workflow authority, preserve the
pre-existing work, and synchronize this annex into the canonical project
manual only after ownership and exact source authority are clean. No workflow,
artifact, repository setting, release or runtime changed in this task.
